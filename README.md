# WubbyLiveTS-API

This is just experimenting with the video streaming idea using HLS and Dash-mpeg, with a potential use case in the future, at the moment it is mostly experimenting. It needs tidying up and proper structure and much further development in the back end design wise before it is used, for example, used for the little wubby live idea.

## State

Right now the back end is a small begninning api with endpoints for signing urls for multipart uploads and some basic database access. Once I can get the final part of multipart uploads working I will fork this so that I have a working example of multipart uploads and then can pursue on with development at a much more rapid pace.
